This is a quick-and-dirty script that generates a cellular automata (rule 110) in a graphics window using the basic graphics library "graphics.py" from https://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/graphics.py

I originally made this to have a pixellated guide for a present I planned on making out of crosstitch.  It can be run with "python cell.py"
